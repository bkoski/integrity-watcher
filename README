= integrity-watcher

integrity-watcher makes it easy to build your integrityapp projects from the command line
(or a cron).

This is just a gemified generalization of iamruinous' integrity-subversion-watcher[http://github.com/iamruinous/integrity-subversion-watcher/tree/master].

== INSTALLATION

  sudo gem install bkoski-integrity-watcher
  
<tt>integrity-watcher</tt> should now be in your path.

== USAGE

  integrity-watcher check PROJECTS --config=/path/to/integrity/config.yml OPTIONS

<tt>PROJECTS</tt> can be either:

* a comma-delimited list of project names (<tt>"Project1,Project2"</tt>)
* "<tt>all</tt>", which will check all projects in integrity
  
==== Options:

  --temp_dir=/some/dir

A lockfile is written into the temp_dir to prevent multiple watchers from running simultaneously.

  --dependency_loader=/path/to/dependency_loader.rb
  
The <tt>dependency_loader</tt> option should point to a file with the <tt>require</tt>s needed to
bootstrap integrity.  For example, it might contain:

  require "integrity/notifier/email"
  Integrity::Notifier.register(Integrity::Notifier::Email)
